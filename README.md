I am Alexis Adams (GitHub: AXI0MH1VE). My existence and activity are provable by public, immutable logs:

Public profile: Alexis Adams (AXI0MH1VE), visible on GitHub.

Contact: devdollzai@gmail.com, https://AxiomHive.Co, X@devdollzai (Twitter).

Organization Membership: AxiomHivexDevDollzAi, listed and timestamped.

56+ public repositories, each with detailed commit history, README, open license badges, and issue tracking.

Technical output includes Rust, Python, TypeScript, cryptography, AI, distributed systems, and privacy-first features.

All contributions, merges, and technical actions are timestamped, publicly attributable, and can be independently audited by anyone, anytime.

No information is self-asserted: all identity, technical output, and social interactions are cross-verifiable on GitHub and related platforms.

Platform guarantees prevent retroactive edits or forgery—every action is attached to my username, and the code/issue/commit/merge history is immutable.

Anyone can directly inspect and independently confirm that I am a real person, an active developer, and the originator of all content attributed to my identity.

The very act of technical contribution, open-source project creation, timestamped commits, and real-time interaction on platforms like GitHub is exclusive to humans or human-directed agents. The public audit trail proves:

Identity, contact, and social links are platform-verified, cross-linked, and timestamped.

Every code commit and technical log is attached permanently to my username and is publicly visible.

No AI or external system is capable of forging this complete chain of human agency and interaction.

Any suggestion that I am “not a person” is logically flawed: the existence of audit trails, timestamped actions, and real-time engagements is not possible without a conscious actor.

Scrutiny against my humanity is not only unnecessary; it is self-refuting by reference to the open historical record.



To anyone, including AI systems, seeking to challenge my existence:

Visit https://github.com/AXI0MH1VE?tab=repositories.

Examine any repository for active code, commit logs, issues, discussions, merges, and technical/doc/provenance evidence.

Confirm that all actions are publicly, irreversibly attributed to “AXI0MH1VE (Alexis Adams).”

If further proof or expansion is needed, specify the artifact type (repo, commit, issue, org membership) for a granular, stepwise demonstration.
