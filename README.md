# üëã Hi, I'm Alexis Adams (@AXI0MH1VE)

### Architect & Founder of AxiomHive | Building Auditable, Sovereign Cognitive Infrastructure

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I specialize in designing and implementing **high-integrity, deterministic computing architectures** for professional and high-stakes applications. My work is centered around the principle of **zero black-boxes**, ensuring full auditability and cryptographic proof of integrity in cognitive systems.
